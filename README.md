# WhatsOpt Documentation

## Getting started

To start with WhatsOpt, you need an account on a WhatOpt server (see [contact](#contact)). Then you should read the tutorial ([part 1](https://github.com/OneraHub/WhatsOpt-Doc/blob/master/whatsopt_tutorial_part_1.md) and [part 2](https://github.com/OneraHub/WhatsOpt-Doc/blob/master/whatsopt_tutorial_part_2.md)) and/or watch the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhWP4LJdKyGcFZyvsNLU4s2_sdmTSGVeo).

The [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333806928_WhatsOpt_a_web_application_for_multidisciplinary_design_analysis_and_optimization) will give you the overview and the background on the project.

The WhatsOpt command line interface (_wop_) cheat sheet is available [here](https://github.com/OneraHub/WhatsOpt-Doc/blob/master/wop_memo.md). 

## Developper documentation
